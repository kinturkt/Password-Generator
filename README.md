# Password-Generator
A strong password helps you:

  - Protect your emails, files, and other content 
  - Prevent someone else from getting in to your account

Your password can be any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols (ASCII-standard characters only).
The following python code will help you to automatically generate a strong password that can be used for any purpose.
The code written is easy to understand, I had imported one python library called 'random' which makes my code very easy.
